# Updating

TJ's DNS records are served by our primary nameserver `ns1.tjhsst.edu (198.38.16.40)` and our secondary nameserver `ns2.tjhsst.edu (198.38.16.41)`. The records themselves are stored in a Git repository on [GitLab](https://github.com/tjcsl/gitbook/tree/935f10b2595581ad854feca84c606b0a3940f668/services/dns/updating/gitlab.tjhsst.edu).

For detailed procedures, see our [Runbooks](../../../general/documentation/runbooks.md).
