# Uptime Robot

**Uptime Robot** is an uptime monitoring service that is responsible for monitoring public TJ CSL services.  It is developed by Uptime Robot Service Provider Ltd. \([https://uptimerobot.com](https://uptimerobot.com)\) and we utilize the free tier to monitor:

* Ion
* Director
* Lists
* TJ Website
* Webmail

Our status page is at [https://status.tjhsst.edu/](https://status.tjhsst.edu/).  We get notified by Uptime Robot on Slack if services go down \(based on a check conducted every five minutes\).
