# Ansible

Ansible is an automation tool that allows us to run scripts to configure services and devices across the lab.  Our goal with Ansible is to have the ability to bring up every service by only running the ansible plays. 

For the purposes of the Lab, "ansibilize" is a word that refers to making a set of systems operate under the control of Ansible plays completely.
