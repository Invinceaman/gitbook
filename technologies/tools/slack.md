# Slack

Slack \([https://slack.com](https://slack.com)\) is a proprietary set of tools for team collaboration. It offers various integration with different services. We have a workspace at [https://tjcsl.slack.com](https://tjcsl.slack.com). The CSL's first widespread use of the Slack workspace began in August of 2018. Slack became the official form of communication under the direction of Omkar Kulkarni.
