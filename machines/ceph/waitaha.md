# Waitaha

**Waitaha** is a physical server residing in the CSL Machine Room that serves as the monitor for the failover Ceph cluster.

Waitaha was purchased by the lab in November of 2012 along with Littleblue as part of a 5-pack deal of used DL380 G5s. The remaining three servers were deployed with the TJ Tech Team.
