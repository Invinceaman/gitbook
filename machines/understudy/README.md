# Understudy

A separate server is given to [Understudies](../../general/understudies.md) for their testing purposes. The Understudies are responsible for setting up and configuring both the server and the Ethernet switch to which it is connected.

## Why an Understudy Server?

Understudies receive this server as their place to explore technologies and get their hands dirty with some of the work that the Sysadmins do. As CSL production machines host many services that are critical to school operation, it wouldn't be a good idea to experiment on them.
