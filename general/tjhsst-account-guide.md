# Account Structure

There are three different accounts that each TJHSST student has:

* FCPS domain
* LOCAL domain
* CSL domain

## FCPS Domain

The FCPS domain is controlled by the FCPS IT department.  Students use their FCPS domain password to access:

* Blackboard
* SIS StudentVue
* FCPS Google Apps for Education
* FCPS computers \(those running Windows 10\)

Password resets on the FCPS domain are handled on the first day of school in homeroom \(on a teacher laptop\).  Questions should be directed to [techteam@tjhsst.edu](mailto:techteam@tjhsst.edu).

## CSL Domain

The CSL domain is controlled by the TJHSST Student Systems Administrators.  We use Kerberos to handle authentications in the CSL realm \(CSL.TJHSST.EDU\).

{% page-ref page="../technologies/authentication/kerberos.md" %}

Students use their CSL domain password to access:

* Ion
* Director
* Webmail
* Remote Access Servers
* Workstations
* and other CSL resources

Passwords are prompted to be reset the first time you login to Ion.  Questions should be directed to [sysadmins@tjhsst.edu](mailto:sysadmins@tjhsst.edu).
