# Repository Maintenance

#### Branches

We maintain two principal branches:

* `master`: hosts the code for production; should be production-ready
* `dev`: hosts the code in preparation for merge to `master`

Feature branches can be created by any committer to host their feature or bugfix branch.

Once a branch has gone three months without activity or it has been merged into the principal branches, it should be deleted and consider "stale".
