# Remote Access

The **Remote Access Servers** \(RASs for short\) provide remote access functionality in the CSL.  We have two remote access servers \(`ras1` and `ras2`\) which are both VMs that are the only machines beyond a select few that provide incoming SSH from outside the CSL network.  They allows TJHSST students and staff to access CSL resources from home.

We use [fail2ban](http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page), an intrusion detection software, to block repeated mass authentication attempts against the remote access servers.

The contact person for the Remote Access Servers is the [Infrastructure Lead](../../general/sysadmins-list.md#current-leads).
