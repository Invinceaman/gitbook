# Remote Access

The **Remote Access Servers** \(RASs for short\) provide remote access functionality in the CSL.  We have two remote access servers \(ras1 and ras2\) which are both VMs that are the only machines other than moon that provide incoming SSH from outside the CSL network.  They allows CSL users, TJHSST students, and TJHSST staff to access CSL resources from home.

We use [fail2ban](http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page), an intrusion detection software, to block repeated mass authentication attempts against the remote access servers.
