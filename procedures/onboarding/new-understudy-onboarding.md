# New Understudy Structure

## Overview

The understudy program's structure and details can vary from year to year.  It generally contains the following components:

* Some public announcements of the availability of the program to interested students
* One or more interest meetings summarizing the program
* A series of understudy sessions structured as the Sysadmins see fit
* A determination of who should be elevated to Sysadmin made before the end of the school year

Decisions made regarding the structure of the understudy program should \(hopefully\) be made well before understudy sessions begin.  These decisions are generally made by Understudy Coordinator\(s\) \(as selected by the Sysadmins\), or, if none exists, the Sysadmins as a group.

## History

In the past, understudy sessions have been open to either the entire school or to a specific set of people accepted via an application process.  These sessions generally involve training prospective Sysadmins in the art of being a Sysadmin, providing support to these prospective Sysadmins, and involving these prospective Sysadmins in CSL projects \(if possible\).
