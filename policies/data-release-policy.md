# Data Release Policy

All requests for data must be made through an email to [sysadmins@tjhsst.edu](mailto:sysadmins@tjhsst.edu) for documentation purposes. Alternatively, the requests can be sent to an appropriate email address that is received by at least two members of the Sysadmin Leadership Team \(for example, [intranet@tjhsst.edu](mailto:intranet@tjhsst.edu) for Ion data or [director@tjhsst.edu](mailto:director@tjhsst.edu) for Director data\). There are 4 tiers of data: publicly accessible, internally accessible, general release, and restricted release.

{% hint style="info" %}
Any type of data that is released must be released **exactly verbatim**, unless approved by the faculty sponsor
{% endhint %}

## Publicly Accessible

### Data that can be accessed by any member of the general public

If data is or was previously posted to a site that the general public can access, then any Sysadmin with access to this data **can release it to any member of the public**.

## Internally Accessible

### Data that can be accessed by any member of the TJ community

If data is or was previously posted to a site that is available for all members of the TJ community, then any Sysadmin with access to the data can release it to any member of the TJ community. For internally accessible data, **the requester must reasonably prove that they are a member of the TJ community** \(e.g. using a TJ/FCPS issued email address or giving their full name\). It is the responsibility of the Sysadmin releasing the data to confirm that the requester is a member of the TJ community. If a Sysadmin is unsure, they can elevate the request to the faculty sponsor.

## General Release

### Single-source data that was previously accessible to the requester

If data comes from one source \(e.g. one file/directory on one device\) and the **requester can reasonably demonstrate that they previously had access to the data**, then the data request can be fulfilled by any Sysadmin with access to the requested data.

## Restricted Release

### Any data that was not previously accessible or any request for non-verbatim data

Data requests that fall into this category _**must**_ **be approved by the faculty sponsor**. This includes any request for processing, summarizing, or aggregating data from multiple sources and any request for data that the requestor did not have access to previously.
