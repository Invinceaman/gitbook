# Election Policy

## Introduction

The Intranet Team administers various student leaderships elections at TJ, including SGA and Class Council elections.  This policy governs the administration of elections by the Sysadmins to ensure election integrity.

## Policy

### Election Administrators

The Intranet Lead shall serve as Election Administrator for student leadership elections. If there are more than one Intranet Leads, they or, in the case of a deadlock, the Sysadmin Leadership Team shall select one  Intranet admin to serve as Election Administrator.  

The Election Administrator may designate an Intranet admin to serve as Deputy Election Administrator. In the absence of the Election Administrator, the Deputy Election Administrator, if any, shall act in the Election Administrator's stead.   "Intranet admins" are all Sysadmins with access to the production Ion server or to administrative interfaces of Ion.

### Conflict of Interest

A "Disqualified Person" is any person serving in the TJHSST Student Government Association, running in the election, or an immediate family member of another Disqualified Person. A Disqualified Person shall also include anyone whose interests, duties, obligations or activities, or those of an immediate family member are, or may be, in conflict or incompatible with the interests of the integrity of the election.  No Intranet admin may exercise their Intranet administrative power while meeting the qualifications of a Disqualified Person. 

Any Intranet admin who becomes a Disqualified Person or believes may be a Disqualified Person should notify the Election Administrator of such, immediately. The Election Administrator shall determine whether such person is a Disqualified Person or elevate the issue to the Faculty Sponsor who shall make a determination. If the Election Administrator is the affected admin, the Administrator shall elevate the issue to the Faculty Sponsor.

If the Election Administrator or Faculty Sponsor judges an Intranet admin to be a Disqualified Person, the affected admin shall cease exercising any administrative power over Ion and recuse themselves from election matters for a period beginning at the start of the election and ending twenty-four hours after the announcement of the election results.  If the affected admin is an Election Administrator or Deputy Election Administrator, they shall step down from that role.  The Ion Lead or designee should remove access to administrative functions for the affected admin for the designated period.
