# Account Policy

## Introduction

The CSL maintains accounts for students and staff at TJHSST.  This document governs authentication in the CSL.

## Policy

### General

* All TJ students are issued a TJ CSL account with a username in the form of `20XXauser` \(the graduation year, first initial, and first seven letters of the last name\)
  * Should someone share someone else's username by this convention those later in the alphabet shall be issued a username with an incrementing number at the end
    * For example, if the class of 2020 has Jason Doe, John Doe, and Julian Doe, Jason Doe shall be `2020jdoe`, John Doe shall be `2020jdoe1` , and Julian Doe shall be `2020jdoe2`
    * If a Jane Doe enters TJ as a sophomore, she shall be issued `2020jdoe3`
* By request, TJ staff members may request a TJ CSL account that shall be the same as their FCPS employee username.
* The Sysadmins shall terminate a TJ CSL account for TJ staff members once their relationship with the school is terminated.
* All activities on the CSL network shall be governed as per the FCPS Acceptable Use Policy.
